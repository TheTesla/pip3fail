    print '''Welcome to the Baskit Minecraft Server Manager!
        
        Baskit is designed to be a minimalistic, yet powerful server management
        system.  Baskit uses GNU-Screen at the heart of the application and
        simply wrap around that.  This means that you can perform in-place
        upgrades of Baskit, or even remove it completely without worry of it
        impacting the running server. There are a lot of functions available to 
        help assist you in managing the server as well, below is a high-level
        list of what is available.  For further detail (including avalable
        options) for any command, type help [COMMAND].

        start                       Starts the server.
        
        stop                        Stops the server.

        restart                     Restarts the server.

        server                      Returns the running state & server binary
                                    information that we have on-hand about
                                    the running server.

        cmd [COMMAND]               Sends the command specified to the server.
                                    There is no limit as to what can be sent
                                    here, and it is quite easy to script
                                    commands into the server with this.

        players                     Returns the list of players currently logged
                                    into the server.

        console                     Will drop you directly into the server
                                    console.  From here you are directly
                                    interacting with the server.  To detach from
                                    the server console, hit CNTRL+A,D to exit.

        update                      Allows you to update the server binary based
                                    on the conditions you had specified.  It's 
                                    highly recommended you run help update to
                                    get some more detail.

        backup                      All backup related functions are housed
                                    within the backup command.  Running "backup"
                                    will present it's help.

        snapshot                    All snapshot related functions are housed
                                    within the snapshot command.  Running
                                    "snapshot" will present it's help.

        sync                        Handles syncing to/from ramdisk and
                                    persistent storage if ramdisk support is
                                    enabled (disabled by default)
