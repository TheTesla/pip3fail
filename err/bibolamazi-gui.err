======================================================================
Bibolamazi -- Prepare consistent BibTeX files for your LaTeX documents
======================================================================

Bibolamazi lets you prepare consistent and uniform BibTeX files for your LaTeX
documents. It lets you prepare your BibTeX entries as you would like them to
be---adding missing or dropping irrelevant information, capitalizing names or
turning them into initials, converting unicode characters to latex escapes, etc.


What Bibolamazi Does
--------------------

Bibolamazi works by reading your reference bibtex files---the ``sources'', which
might for example have been generated by your favorite bibliography manager or
provided by your collaborators---and merging them all into a new file, applying
specific rules, or ``filters'', such as turning all the first names into
initials or normalizing the way arxiv IDs are presented.

The Bibolamazi file is this new file, in which all the required bibtex entries
will be merged. When you prepare you LaTeX document, you should create a new
bibolamazi file, and provide that bibolamazi file as the bibtex file for the
bibliography.

When you open a bibolamazi file, you will be prompted to edit its configuration.
This is the set of rules which will tell bibolamazi where to look for your
bibtex entries and how to handle them. You first need to specify all your
sources, and then all the filters.

The bibolamazi file is then a valid BibTeX file to include into your LaTeX
document, so if your bibolamazi file is named `main.bibolamazi.bib', you would
include the bibliography in your document with a LaTeX command similar to:

    \bibliography{main.bibolamazi}


The Bibolamazi Configuration Section
------------------------------------

If you open the Bibolamazi application and open your bibolamazi file (or create
a new one), youâ€™ll immediately be prompted to edit its configuration section.

Sources are the normal bibtex files from which bibtex entries are read. A source
is specified using the bibolamazi command

  src: source-file.bib  [ alternative-source-file.bib  ... ]

Alternative source locations can be specified, in case the first file does not
exist. This is convenient to locate a file which might be in different locations
on different computers. Each source file name can be an absolute path or a
relative path (relative to the bibolamazi file). It can also be an HTTP URL
which will be downloaded automatically.

You can specify several sources by repeating the src: command.

  src: first-source.bib  alternative-first-source.bib
  src: second-source.bib
  ...

Remember: the *first* readable source of *each* source command will be read, and
merged into the bibolamazi file.

Filters are rules to apply on the whole bibliography database. Their syntax is

  filter: filter_name  <filter-options>

The filter is usually meant to deal with a particular task, such as for example
changing all first names of authors into initials.

For a list of filters and what they do, please refer the first page of this help
browser.

You can usually fine-tune the behavior of the filter by providing options. For
a list of options for a particular filter, please refer again to the help page
of that filter.


What now?
---------

We suggest at this point that you create a new bibolamazi file, and get started
with the serious stuff :)

You might want to have a look at the documentation. It is available at:

  http://bibolamazi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

If you want an example, you can have a look at the directory

  https://github.com/phfaist/bibolamazi/tree/master/test

and, in particular the bibolamazi files `testX.bibolamazi.bib`.


Command-line
------------

Please note that you can also use bibolamazi in command-line. If you installed
the precompiled application, you'll need to install the command-line version
again. Go to

  https://github.com/phfaist/bibolamazi

and follow the instructions there.
